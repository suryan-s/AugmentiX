# AugmentiX
🚀 YOLO Dataset Augmentation Library 🖼️

## Project Overview

Welcome to AugmentiX, an image augmentation library designed to enhance your sample dataset for object detection, 
particularly tailored for YOLO-based training datasets. The library provides a convenient GUI interface for specifying 
the number of samples, desired augmentation tasks, and the output directory to save the augmented images.

### Problem Statement

AugmentiX addresses the challenges in efficiently augmenting datasets for object detection. Traditional methods often 
involve coding augmentation tasks for each training, leading to time-consuming processes. This library aims to simplify 
the augmentation process, offering an intuitive GUI and performing tasks such as random rotation, cropping, flipping, 
brightness adjustments, blur, noise, and more.

### Features

- **User-Friendly GUI:** Easily specify the number of samples, augmentation tasks, and output directory through a graphical interface.
- **Comprehensive Augmentation Tasks:** Perform various augmentation tasks, including random rotation, cropping, flipping, brightness adjustments, blur, and noise.
- **Annotation File Generation:** Create annotation files for augmented images, streamlining the dataset preparation process.
- **Performance Enhancement with Rust:** Utilize Rust bindings for improved performance, especially in I/O operations.

## Getting Started

To start using AugmentiX, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: [Your GitHub Repository Link]
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the GUI interface to set augmentation parameters and generate augmented images.

## Motivation

AugmentiX was born out of a personal need to address the limitations of existing image augmentation libraries,
especially in the context of YOLO-based projects.
As a practitioner in object detection, the creator faced challenges with current libraries,
inspiring the development of a comprehensive solution that streamlines the augmentation process 
and integrates seamlessly with YOLO training.
